            In the mythological story “How the kangaroo got her pouch”, the author
            explores the theme of kindness.
            We learn that once, the great god Byamee wanted to find the most kind
            creature, so he descended from the sky and disguised himself as an old, sick
            and uncared for wombat, who is seeking help for sustenance and care. The
            wombat’s interaction with the kangaroo is pictured in this story. Byamee was
            overjoyed to see the kangaroo’s kindness right from the beginning as she cared
            for the wombat like she would do for her own joey. Leading the wombat to
            the juiciest grass, cleanest water and selflessly saving him from the hunter won
            Byamee’s heart . Consequently, the great god Byamee gifted the kangaroo with
            her pouch so that she never loses her joey as she had lost the joey while helping
            the wombat. On seeing the kangaroo’s kindness for her fellow animals, Byamee
            also gifted pouches to all marsupials so that their babies would never get lost
            again.

          <p style="text-align: left;"> <b>PHRASES and CLAUSES- OVERVIEW:</b> <br> <br>

            Phrases and Clauses are both parts of a sentence with different features and
            roles. 
            A phrase is a combination of words which cannot produce meaning
            independently and does not have a subject-verb combination.
            Clauses are groups of words which can produce meaning independently and
            always contain a subject-verb combination. <br>

            Phrases are not divided into types based on structure and function. Clauses are
            divided into Subordinate/Dependent clauses and Principal/Independent
            Clauses. <br>
            Principal Clauses can produce complete meaning on their own and thus are
            sentences.
            Subordinate clauses depend on Principal clauses to make complete sense.
            Subordinate Clauses are introduced in sentences by subordinate conjunctions
            and Relative Pronouns. <br>
            Principal Clause do not have types but Subordinate clauses have quite some
            types which will discussed later in detail.
